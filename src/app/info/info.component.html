    <mat-card-content>
        <p>
            This is just an application that i wrote to develop my programming skills <br>
            It's written on Angular and it uses most of the basic concepts of this awesome Javascript Framework <br>
            You can check the source code on the 'Source' button on the navbar. It will take you to my github page. <br>
            Feel free to download and change it as much as you want.
